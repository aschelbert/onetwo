    </div>

    <div class="legal-body">

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the ONE two HOA GovOps platform, including the website at <a href="https://www.getonetwo.com">www.getonetwo.com</a> and associated web and mobile applications (collectively, the "Service"), operated by ONE two, Inc. ("ONE two," "we," "us," or "our").</p>

        <p>By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

        <h2 class="display">1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal authority to enter into these Terms. If you are using the Service on behalf of a condominium association, homeowners association, cooperative, or other community organization ("Community"), you represent that you have the authority to bind that Community to these Terms.</p>

        <h2 class="display">2. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>To access the Service, you must create an account with accurate and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access at <a href="mailto:support@getonetwo.com">support@getonetwo.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Accounts are assigned one of three roles—Board Member, Resident, or Property Manager—each with distinct access levels and permissions as described in the Service documentation.</p>

        <h2 class="display">3. Use of the Service</h2>

        <h3>Permitted Use</h3>
        <p>You may use the Service for its intended purpose: managing governance, compliance, finances, communications, and operations for residential community associations. You agree to use the Service in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including the laws of the jurisdiction where your Community is located.</p>

        <h3>Prohibited Conduct</h3>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable law or regulation.</li>
            <li>Upload false, misleading, defamatory, or harassing content.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other users' accounts, data, or any part of the Service's infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any part of the Service.</li>
            <li>Use automated tools (bots, scrapers) to access the Service without our express written permission.</li>
            <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service.</li>
            <li>Resell, sublicense, or redistribute the Service to third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="display">4. Subscription Plans &amp; Pricing</h2>
        <p>The Service is offered through tiered subscription plans (e.g., Essentials, Compliance Pro, Advanced Governance) as described on our pricing page. Features, limits, and pricing vary by plan and are subject to change with reasonable notice.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Free Trials:</strong> We may offer free trial periods. At the end of a trial, your subscription will convert to a paid plan unless you cancel beforehand.</li>
            <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Subscriptions are billed monthly or annually as selected at the time of purchase. All fees are quoted in U.S. dollars and are non-refundable except as expressly stated in these Terms or required by law.</li>
            <li><strong>Price Changes:</strong> We may adjust pricing with at least 30 days' written notice before your next billing cycle. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.</li>
            <li><strong>Introductory Offers:</strong> Promotional rates (including the introductory Compliance Pro rate of $1,500/year for early enrollees) are subject to the terms stated at the time of enrollment and may not be combined with other offers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="display">5. Community Data &amp; Content</h2>

        <h3>Your Content</h3>
        <p>You retain ownership of all data, documents, and content you upload to the Service ("Your Content"), including governing documents, meeting notes, financial records, and community communications. By using the Service, you grant ONE two a limited, non-exclusive license to host, process, and display Your Content solely as necessary to provide the Service.</p>

        <h3>Shared Content</h3>
        <p>Content you submit to shared areas of the platform (e.g., community issue reports, event postings, discussion threads) may be visible to other members of your Community in accordance with role-based access controls. You are responsible for ensuring that content you share is appropriate and does not violate the rights of others.</p>

        <h3>Data Portability</h3>
        <p>Upon written request, we will provide a reasonable export of Your Content in a standard format within 30 days.</p>

        <h2 class="display">6. Compliance Guidance Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>The Service provides compliance workflows, legal checklists, and regulatory guidance as informational tools only. Nothing in the Service constitutes legal advice.</strong> ONE two is not a law firm and does not provide legal representation. The compliance information provided (including DC Condominium Act workflows, DCRA procedures, state-specific guidance, pre-legal steps, and self-representation guidance) is designed to help your Community understand its obligations, but should not be relied upon as a substitute for qualified legal counsel.</p>
        <p>We make reasonable efforts to keep compliance content accurate and current, but laws and regulations change frequently. You are responsible for verifying the applicability of any guidance to your specific situation with a licensed attorney.</p>

        <h2 class="display">7. Payment Processing</h2>
        <p>Assessment payments and other financial transactions processed through the Service are handled by our third-party payment processor. By using payment features, you agree to the payment processor's terms of service. ONE two is not responsible for errors, delays, or failures caused by the payment processor. We do not directly store credit card or bank account numbers.</p>

        <h2 class="display">8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>The Service, including its design, features, code, compliance workflows, branding, and documentation, is owned by ONE two and protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. These Terms do not grant you any ownership rights in the Service. The ONE two name, logo, and related marks are trademarks of ONE two, Inc.</p>

        <h2 class="display">9. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Your use of the Service is also governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how we collect, use, and protect your information. By using the Service, you consent to the practices described in the Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2 class="display">10. Termination</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>By You:</strong> You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@getonetwo.com">support@getonetwo.com</a>. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. No refunds are provided for partial periods.</li>
            <li><strong>By Us:</strong> We may suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms, fail to pay fees when due, or engage in conduct that harms other users or the integrity of the Service. We will provide reasonable notice where practicable.</li>
            <li><strong>Effect of Termination:</strong> Upon termination, your access to the Service ceases. We will retain Your Content for 60 days following termination, during which time you may request an export. After 60 days, we may delete Your Content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="display">11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, ONE two and its officers, directors, employees, and agents shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service, including but not limited to loss of data, loss of revenue, or regulatory penalties incurred by your Community.</p>
        <p>Our total aggregate liability for any claims arising under these Terms shall not exceed the amount you paid to ONE two in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</p>

        <h2 class="display">12. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components, or that any compliance guidance is complete, accurate, or current.</p>

        <h2 class="display">13. Indemnification</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless ONE two, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any third-party rights.</p>

        <h2 class="display">14. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of the Service shall be governed by the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the District of Columbia for any disputes that cannot be resolved informally. Before filing any claim, you agree to attempt to resolve the dispute by contacting us at <a href="mailto:legal@getonetwo.com">legal@getonetwo.com</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="display">15. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated Terms on this page and, where appropriate, by email. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of revised Terms constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Service.</p>

        <h2 class="display">16. General Provisions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Entire Agreement:</strong> These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and ONE two regarding the Service.</li>
            <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.</li>
            <li><strong>Waiver:</strong> Our failure to enforce any provision does not constitute a waiver of that provision.</li>
            <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign your rights under these Terms without our written consent. We may assign our rights without restriction.</li>
        </ul>
